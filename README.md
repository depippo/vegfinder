# VeganFoodFinder

## Description
Vegan Food Finder is an Angular single page application with a Rails backend. Using the Foursqaure API, it allows users to search for restaurants that offer vegan vegan fare, browse restaurants recommended by other users of the site, review restaurants, and save a list of their favorites.

## How to Use

Fork and clone this repo, and then navigate into the vegfinder directory in your terminal. Enter the command `rake db:migrate` to set up the database, and then load up the site with the command `rails s`. You will be prompted to register before you can start browsing. Once you've registered, you can get started by clicking search and entering your location.
